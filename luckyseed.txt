A farmer was on his way to the market to sell a bag of seeds. His cart bumped into a stone and a seed fell out of the bag. “I wish I could, be safe underground,” thought the seed. A passing buffalo pushed the seed into the ground! “I am so thirsty. I need some water to help me grow,” thought the seed. It began rain! The next day the seed had a green shoot. The sun came out and the shoot grew tall. Then a leaf appeared. A hungry bird tried to pluck and eat the seed but the roots saved it. Many years passed and the seed grew into a plant and then into a fine, strong tree. Now don’t you think that the seed was lucky?
